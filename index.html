      <h3>How to Keep Yellow Jackets Away</h3>
      <H1>Yellow Jacket wasps(Vespula germanica)</H1>
      <H3>top 4 wasp questions </H3>
      <h4>how do you tell the difference between female and male Yellow Jacket wasps ?</h4>
      <h5>Observe the insect's size. Size is the most obvious difference between the male and female wasps. Females are larger than the males because they carry the eggs. Due to this extra baggage, their abdomen is usually fatter and fuller.</h5>
      <h4>what are wasps attracted to ?</h4>
      <h5>In late summer and early fall, wasps turn their attention to sweet foods. Their behavior is also more aggressive.Wasps will mostly be looking for any strong source of sugar. Root beer, fruit juices, sugar water, and colas all make excellent liquid wasp trap baits. The wasps will smell the sugar and come right for it as quick as they can. You can also use diluted jams, jellies, and fruits to make effective liquid bait.</h5>
      <h4>What colors are wasps attracted to ?</h4>
      <h5>Bees and wasps instinctively perceive dark colors as a threat. Wear white, tan, cream, or gray clothing as much as possible and avoid black, brown, or red clothes. Bees and wasps see the color red as black, so they perceive it as a threat<h5>
      <h4>what foods do wasps like most ?</h4>
      <h5>Typically, wasps eat insects, plants, fruits, nectar, and honey. The adult wasps do not actually eat the insects, and instead paralyzes them and feed them to their larvae.</h5>

      <h3>10 ant facts</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>Archaeologists estimate that Homo sapiens (modern humans) have been on the Earth for some 200,000 years. That’s just a fraction of the age of the Earth, which is some 4.54 billion years old. The first humans evolved (“Homo“) from australopithecine ancestors about 2 million years ago. This time frame makes ants far, far older than humanity. Scientists estimate that ants came about in the mid-Cretaceous period, which was an amazing 110 to 130 million years ago. Accordingly, humans are the babies on planet Earth.</li>
      <li>Ants are quite the travelers. They are found nearly everywhere on Earth, with the exception of Antarctica and the Arctic (there are also a few islands that seem to be free of ants). There is one species of ant, the Argentine ant, known as Linepithema humile species, that has invaded 6 continents. Within the last century, these little critters have established themselves in at least 15 countries throughout the world, and they don’t seem to be stopping their conquest. The hives are literally swarming across the planet.</li>
      <li>The largest ant ever discovered is (un)fortunately not alive today. Rather, it is a fossilized specimen that belongs to Titanomyrma giganteum, and it was truly a beast of an ant. Have you ever accidentally walked through an ant colony and looked down to find a plethora of ants stalking about on your foot? Well, imagine having a bunch of superlarge, mutant ants walking up your leg!Okay, so the ants in the fossil weren’t mutants, but they kind of looked a bit like it. This fossil reveals that T. giganteum was about 2.4 inches (6 cm) long, and it seems that it had a wingspan of nearly six inches(!). For comparison, the average size of the current ant species is a mere .08 to 1 inches (.2 to 2.5 cm).</li>
      <li>Ants can come together to form an enormous, coordinated “super organism.” Just as humans are able to function because of all of the various organs that comprise our bodies, so do individual ants function as parts of a larger organism. There are a number of individual parts (ants) that fit together to cooperate and accomplish amazing feats. Rather than working as individuals, they function as parts of a collective whole, doing what is best for the colony as a collective. For example, a swarm of ants work together to select the ideal location for the hive, whereas a single ant may make a mistake. Ants are able to do this because of the way that they communicate (more on that later). They “talk” in such a way that they form a seamless, brain-like structure.</li>
      <li>Ants are able to communicate and cooperate effectively by using chemicals known as “pheromones.” Through these chemicals, ants are able to send simple messages to their fellows, alerting them to danger or indicating when food has been located. The workers will release pheromones with specific messages in order to say things like, “I’ll show you where food is!” or “Danger, Will Robinson!” (okay, so that last one would really be a bit more like “Intruder Alert. Attack!)
        In this respect, individual members of an ant colony are able to “talk” with each other in order to coordinate their efforts by using their antenna to smell the chemicals that other ants release. As it turns out, this is a rather rapid and effective form of communication.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of ants on E arth. A lot. Although they may be small, they add up quite a bit. Entomologist Ted R. Schultz noted in an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that ants ``monopolize 15—20% of the terrestrial animal biomass, and in tropical regions where ants are especially abundant, they monopolize 25% or more.” However, it must be noted that ants are a taxonomic Family that is made up of some 20,000 known species, which ultimately means that we can’t actually say that they have the largest biomass of any individual species on Earth.</li>
      <li>Ants may seem like simple creatures, but they actually have rather evolved and complex societies (with an ant queen and all). There are several ant species that raid neighboring colonies in order to steal eggs or larvae to bring back to their own colonies. This is a practice that is known as “dulosis.” Of course, these forcibly acquired young are  not always turned into slaves. Sometimes they are used as a food source (they are eaten). The species that use dulosis are informally called “slave-making ants,” and many of the ant species that use this practice do so in order to support their colonies.</li>
      <li>Ants, like most small insects, are rather powerful. They are able to lift 3 times their body weight, and they can dangle while holding some 100 times their own weight. This is rather impressive, but they aren’t the strongest critters around. The dung beetle is the strongest known insect, as they are able to lift a staggering 1000 times their own weight.</li>
      <li>Compared to a human, ants are only on this planet for a brief time. Many species only live for a few weeks. However, some ants can live for years. In fact, many queen ants can live for decades (the oldest ant lived for an astounding 30 years!).</li>
      <li>There are 7 billion humans on Earth. That’s quite a lot of people, but it’s nothing compared to ants. Current estimates assert that there are about 10 quadrillion ants on the planet. That’s 10,000,000,000,000,000. Let’s hope that we don't ever decide to stage a coup d’etat…</li>

      <h3>7 Things ants love</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>Sweets: Above all else, ants love sweets. Anything high in sugar tends to attract ants, and they love scoping out things like jelly, syrup, honey, candy, and juices. So if you want to avoid ants flocking your indoor or outdoor property. </li>
      <li>Grease: Some ants prefer foods that are high in fats and grease. This is why you are so likely to see ants swarming discarded fast food remnants. It’s also why ants are so attracted to salami.</li>
      <li>Proteins: Like humans, ants need a lot of protein to grow strong. This is why many ants love meat, since it is high in both grease and protein. They may also be attracted to peanut butter, eggs, and like I said salami.</li>
      <li>Other Insects/Animals: When ants cannot find their protein in human foods, they will often look elsewhere for sustenance. It’s well known that insects are a great source of protein, which is why ants will sometimes eat other insects, or even feast on the body of dead animals. This is particularly common in carpenter ants, which may try to find protein and sugar in your kitchen or in the discarded carcasses of other creatures.</li>
      <li>Seeds: Because fire ants sting people, many assume they are carnivores. However, while fire ants do consume proteins and sugars like other species of ants, they also derive a lot of their fuel from eating seeds.</li>
      <li>Fungus: Species like the leafcutter ant actually cultivate and eat their own fungus, which is why you are likely to find this ant in your garden, where the environment is ideal for fungi growth.</li>
      <li>Anything Damp: Ants are naturally drawn to moisture, so any food that is damp is pretty much catnip to them. Again, this is why ants love garbage, and why it is important to clean up spills in your kitchen and around your home as soon as you can.</li>
      <h3>top 12 questions ,all about ants☺☻☺☻ッツتシ😃😄😈😇😊😊😉😌😁</h3>
      <h4>What is the world's rarest ant?</h4>
      <h5>Nothomyrmecia, also known as the dinosaur ant or dawn ant, is a rare genus of ants consisting of a single species, Nothomyrmecia macrops.</h5>
      <h4>When was the first ant on earth?</h4>
      <h5> 140 to 168 million years ago,Ants first appeared on the earth between 140 to 168 million years ago, during the Jurassic period—a time when dinosaurs roamed the land and plant life consisted mostly of cone- and spore-bearing species like pines and ferns.</h5>
       <h4>what's the most poisonous ant in the world ?</h4>
       <h5>bulldog ant.The most dangerous ant in the world is the bulldog ant (Myrmecia pyriformis) found in coastal regions in Australia. In attack it uses its sting and jaws simultaneously. There have been at least three human fatalities since 1936, the latest a Victorian farmer in 1988.</h5>
       <h4>what is the strongest ant in the world ?</h4>
       <h5>Leafcutter ant .Tiny leafcutter ants can lift and carry in their jaws something 50 times their own body weight of about 500mg. That's the same as a human lifting a truck with its teeth.</h5>
       <h4>do ants have blood ?</h4>
       <h5>The short answer is ants have something similar to blood, but scientists call it “haemolymph”. ... Your blood is red because it contains lots of tiny, tiny packages called “red blood cells”, which carry oxygen around your body. Ants and other insects also have a liquid inside their body that moves nutrients around.</h5>
       <h4>Where do Polyrhachis ants live?</h4>
       <h5>dives is found in open woodlands and swampy coastal plains, where it builds a characteristic carton structure on the lower branches of grasses, trees and shrubs, joining the foliage and twigs with larval silk to form the nest</h5>
       <h4>can ants swim?</h4>
       <h5>Well, not all ants can swim, it depends on the species. They haven't mastered the butterfly or breaststroke, yet, but they do have the ability to survive in water by using their own version of the doggy paddle, and can also float for long periods of time. To put it simply, ants are amazing survivors.</h5>
      <h4> What is Polyrhachis vicina Roger?</h4> 
      <h5>Edible black ant ( Polyrhachis vicina Roger) is a traditional edible insect species in China. It has long been used as an important ingredient of health foods. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of organic compounds following sun drying of edible black ant.</h5>
      <h4>How many ant subspecies are there?</h4>
       <h5>Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies.</h5>
       <h4>Are ants blue?</h4>
       <h5>Identification. The wingless, ground-dwelling female Blue Ants are bright metallic blue or green, and can sometimes be mistaken for a large ant. However they are a solitary wasp species, with fully winged males, and can often be found on flowers.</h5>

      <h5>Habitats range from degraded primary dipterocarp forests to secondary forests and even extensively used coconut groves with rich undergrowth in lowlands and low montane regions. The second author frequently collected workers and gynes during daytime foraging on leaves and twigs of small trees and bushes, rarely on the ground, but did not encounter nest sites. Gary Alpert (in litt.) found nests occupying cavities in branches, both on the ground and in low vegetation; one nest had approximately 100 individuals and a single queen.

      <h1>millipedes (narceus americanus)</h1>
       <p>The millipede’s name means "thousand-legger", which is what they appear to be. Millipedes actually have only 200 to 300 legs and at least four eyes. They are gentle and easy to handle, sleep during the day and come out in the evening to eat. </p>
       <img src="milli.jpeg" alt="millipede">
       <h3>Millipede Facts<h3>
       <p>Scientific Name:	narceus americanus <br>Average Adult Size:	4 to 11 inches long <br>Average Life Span	3+ years with proper care <br>
       <h3>Diet</h3>
       <ul>
       <li>Vegetables and fruit,such as romaine lettuce,squash, melon slices and bananas; avoid iceberg lettuce because it does not provide enough nourishment.</li>
       <li>Apples and cucumbers are favorites but everything must be sliced or peeled due to their weak mouthparts.</li>
       <li> Ground cuttlebone will supply needed lime salts. </li>
       <h3>Feeding</h3>
      <li>Feed once a day, as much food as they will consume in a night.</li>
      <li>Discard uneaten vegetables and fruits each morning.</li>
      <li>Water - Always have a shallow dish of chlorine free water available; place a sponge or stones in the dish to keep the millipede from drowning; if a sponge is used in the dish it must be replaced often due to bacteria growth.</li>
      <li></li>
      <h3>Housing</h3>
      <li> Size - Appropriately sized habitat, such as a 5 to 10 gallon glass aquarium, with a screen mesh lid fastened tightly with metal clips to prevent escape.</li>
      <li>Hideaway - Provide a hideaway to help your milipede feel secure.</li>
      <li>Substrate - Mulch-type commercial material, dampened sphagnum moss and bark; avoid gravel and artificial turf (too harsh).</li>
      <li>Temperature - 60 to 78°F.</li>
      <li>Lighting - Keep habitat away from sunlight; millipedes sleep during the day and do not like bright, hot lights; a red or blue bulb will allow you to watch the evening activities of your millipede without disturbance.</li>
      <li>Millipedes may be housed with other millipedes of the same species but do not house different invertebrate species together.</li>
      <h3>Normal Behavior</h3>
      <li>Generally easy to handle; millipedes don’t bite, move slowly and have tough shells.</li>
      <li>Nocturnal (active at night).</li>
      <li>When feeling threatened, they curl up into a tight spiral with their shells to the outside to protect themselves and may secrete a foul-smelling and -tasting fluid meant to repel predators. Always wash your hands after handling a millipede.</li>
      <h3>Habitat Maintenance</h3>
      <li>Thoroughly clean and disinfect the habitat at least once a week: place millipede in a secure habitat; scrub the tank and furnishings with a 3% bleach solution; rinse thoroughly with water, removing all traces of bleach smell. Dry the tank and furnishings before adding clean substrate.</li>
      <h3>Grooming & Hygiene</h3>
      <li>Handle as little as possible; wash hands before and after handling. Do not allow a millipede’s secretion to come into contact with eyes, mouth or open wounds.</li>
      <h3>Health</h3>
      <h4>Signs of a Healthy Animal</h4>
      <li>Eats regularly</li>
      <li>Body is rounded and full</li>
      <li>Active and alert</li>
      <li>Healthy skin(exoskeleton)</li>
      <h4>Red Flags</h4>
      <li>Poor appetite</li>
      <li>Lethargic</li>
      <li>Fungus</li>
      <li>Dull shell</li>
      <h4>Common Health Issues</h4>
      <li>Health Issue	Symptoms or Causes	Suggested Action <br>
        Dehydration	- Lethargic, shriveled appearance.	Consult with a veterinarian. <br>
        Fungus - Loss of appetite, white fuzzy patches.	Consult your veterinarian.</li>

       <li> Crickets are a delicacy </li>
       <p>In many parts of the world, crickets are considered a delicacy. They’re prepared in many different ways! In Thailand, fried crickets are commonly served with beer; one of the most popular snacks in the country is Jing Leed, a deep-fried cricket seasoned with sauce and pepper.</p>
       <li>Crickets are extremely lightweight</li>
      <p>Almost all types of crickets weigh between .2 and .8 grams—or .0007 to .003 ounces. To put these numbers in perspective, a paper clip weighs one gram!</p>
       <li> Crickets are a symbol of good luck</li>
       <p>In China, crickets are a traditional symbol of good luck. In the imperial era, crickets were a popular pet for nobles and commoners alike. They were often kept in bamboo or even golden cages.</p>
       <li>Crickets don’t have lungs </li>
       <p>Like many other insects, crickets don’t have lungs and can’t breathe through their mouths or nostrils. Instead, they take air in through a series of small holes on the sides of their bodies called spiracles.</p>
